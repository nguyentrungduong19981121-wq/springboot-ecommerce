# Customer cancels order
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/orders/9/status \

```

## ⚙️ Stock Management

### Automatic Stock Reduction

When creating an order:
```
Before Order:
  Product: Laptop Dell XPS 13
  Stock: 10

Customer Orders:
  Quantity: 2

After Order:
  Product: Laptop Dell XPS 13
  Stock: 8
```

### Insufficient Stock Handling

```
Product Stock: 5
Customer Orders: 10

Result: 400 Bad Request
Message: "Insufficient stock for product: Laptop Dell XPS 13. Available: 5, Requested: 10"
Order NOT created, stock NOT reduced
```

### Transaction Safety
- ✅ Stock updates are transactional
- ✅ If order creation fails → stock is NOT reduced
- ✅ If any product has insufficient stock → entire order fails
- ✅ All-or-nothing approach

## 📊 Order Status Workflow

```
┌─────────┐
│ PENDING │ ← Order created
└────┬────┘
     │ Payment received
     ▼
┌─────────┐
│  PAID   │
└────┬────┘
     │ Admin ships
     ▼
┌─────────┐
│ SHIPPED │
└────┬────┘
     │ Admin confirms delivery
     ▼
┌──────────┐
│DELIVERED │
└──────────┘

Any status → CANCELLED (with restrictions)
```
